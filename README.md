Language Model Training - AI4Bharat VITS

This project involves training a language model using AI4Bharat VITS, designed to enable NLP capabilities for the Bharat languages. The repository contains training scripts, data processing, and model fine-tuning steps necessary for developing and deploying a language model tailored for Bharat-specific languages.



 Project Overview

The AI4Bharat VITS language model training project is aimed at creating an efficient model specifically for Bharat languages. The model leverages [VITS (Variational Inference Text-to-Speech)](https://github.com/jaywalnut310/vits) for better processing and transformation of linguistic features, potentially encompassing:
- Multi-lingual training
- Text and speech synthesis features
- High performance on low-resource language data

Features

Language-Specific Tokenization: Supports tokenization tailored to Bharat languages.
Text-to-Speech Capability: Utilizes VITS framework to enable text-to-speech synthesis.
Customizable Parameters: Offers options for hyperparameter tuning and data pre-processing for optimal model performance.

 Installation

To set up the project, we ensure the following dependencies are installed:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/AI4Bharat-VITS.git
   cd AI4Bharat-VITS
   ```

2. Install necessary packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Additional requirements:

   - [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) (for deep learning operations)
   - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (for data processing)

 Usage

1. Data Pre-processing: Pre-process the dataset using the provided scripts.

   

2. Model Training: Launch model training is done with your preferred configuration file. Adjusted hyperparameters as needed to optimize for your dataset.



3. Inference: Use the trained model to perform inference on sample text inputs.

   

Model Training

Training is conducted using the AI4Bharat VITS framework, which includes:

- Data Loader: Custom data loaders to handle Bharat languages.
- Model Architecture: VITS-based structure adapted for multi-lingual and text-to-speech tasks.
- Training Configuration: Adjust model parameters in `config.yml` based on the dataset characteristics and desired model performance.

Evaluation

Evaluate the trained model using standard NLP metrics like BLEU or WER, and TTS-specific metrics such as MOS for speech synthesis quality.
